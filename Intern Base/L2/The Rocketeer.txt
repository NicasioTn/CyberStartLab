Briefing L02 C01

The Rocketeer
Weâ€™ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.

They have given us a command that triggers a launch sequence that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command is launchRocket() Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?

Tip: You can run JavaScript commands in the Console.
