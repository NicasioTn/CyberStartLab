Briefing L01 C04

Lazy Locked Login
The agency recently purchased a homehub for the office to automate appliances like lights and thermostats. But recently, we've been receiving complaints about irregular temperature changes and lights unpredictably turning on and off.

We've found where you can access the homehub settings along with the sign in details, but it turns out you can only submit the form and sign in from a technicians laptop. We need you to figure out how we can bypass this restriction so we can adjust the settings and restore normality in the office!

Tip: Try to inspect the login form with the tools provided to see what is stopping you from submitting the form and signing in.
