Maths at Light Speed
Intern, I hope you know how to use a calculator? Of course you do. In theory you should be able to bypass this security gateway to a warehouse we believe holds clues to the whereabouts of a gang we are in hot pursuit of.

The thing is, the gateway was created by someone who loves doing everything super fast! You only get 0.1 seconds to answer the question asked by the gateway. Can you find a way around it? We're not able to formulate an action quick enough.

Tip: Bypass the calculator lock to get the flag.
