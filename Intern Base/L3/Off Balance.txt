Off Balance
We're hot on the heels of catching this cyber gang but the closer we get, the more damage they try to inflict onto the Barcelona tourism industry!

This time, they've hacked into a large international bank's mobile application. Customers of the bank are complaining they can't see their current balance and these criminal masterminds need to be held to account. Intern, help customers retrieve their balances, so they can continue to spend their money during their well-earned holidays!

Helping our international friends will really help develop our network.
